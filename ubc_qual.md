I plan to use the books:  
Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote  
Algebra: Chapter 0 by Paolo Aluffi  
Baby Rudin  
Big Rudin  
Maybe, Functions of one complex variable by Conway    
I am excited to start reading! But meanwhile, I am also a little bit worried as the past qual exams seem difficult...Hopefully things go well :) ALso, hope tonight Liverpool can win..

I back home for almost two weeks. I am in a class for a driving license (C1). Tomorrow will be the Subject 1 test. I also studied for the qual exam since April 8. In general, I am satisfied with my current life. But I have to say, I can do much better! I can study way longer than now. Hopefully, after passing the Subject 1 test, I can work harderrrrr!   

PS: there is a surprising result for finite groups: There is a unique fixed point free order 2 automorphism for finite groups, i.e. $g\mapsto g^{-1}$. And there is none for non-abelian groups! I dont know if this result is still true for infinite groups, since in the proof, I do use the fact of finiteness. Hint from Dummit & Foote: If $\psi$ is a fixed point free order 2 auto, then for all g in G, $g = x^{-1}\psi(x)$ for some $x\in G$. This can be proved by showing that $x\mapsto x^{-1}\psi(x)$ is a bijection from $G\to G$. The bijection comes from the injection and the finiteness.

A few days ago, I was reading the baby rudin. There is an amazing result: Let $\sum a_n$ be a series that converges non-absolutely. Let $-\infty\leq\alpha\leq\beta\leq\infty$. Then there exists an rearrangement, $\sum a^{'}_n$ with partial sum $s_n^{'}$, such that $liminf s_n^{'} = \alpha$ and $limsup s_n^{'} = \beta$.

Today, I did an interesting exercise on Baby Rudin. For a metric space $X$, there exists a completion, $X^*$. So I thought maybe we can construct $\mathbb{R}$ out of $\mathbb{Q}$ from completion.

I did the exercise a few days ago, construct $\mathbb{R}$ from Cauchy sequences. It is a completion of $\mathbb{Q}$. For completion, I mean every Cauchy seuqnces converge. It is a good exercise. I wrote down all of the exercise explicitly except to prove it is actually complete. But I indeed have a idea and I think my idea is correct.  

I also switched my algebra book to algebra: chapter 0. Dummit&Foote's book is too detailed. It kind of makes me bored. I only read a few section of Paolo's book. Great! I like it! 

Some non-academic update: I failed my driving license Subject 2 test today. I did pretty well at the mock tests. I nailed the mock tests. But I failed the test. I am afraid that this will delay my plan. But i comfort myself: If the plan can be delayed for 20 days, it is probably not very urgent. Furthermore, I am lucky for two times: got distinction and got admission from UBC. So it is time for me to be not luck. And it is just a driving test, not some big thing, so embrace it! Imagine Henderson, my failed driving test is not a problem, I will try next time!

I recently think of (maybe inspired) a proof of Bezout's theorem of integers. Let m,n be positive integers, gcd(m,n)=1, then there exists a,b such that am + bn =1. Although this result can be generalized to much bigger rings, perhaps UFD, let us only talk about integers now. The proof does not need Euclidean ALgorithm. Since gcd(m,n)=1, $[m]_n$ generates $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. So $[1]_n = a[m]_n$. This means $1\equiv am$ mod $n$. Hence bn = 1 - am.

I have to say, so far, the only topic makes me exicted in real analysis is integration!   


2024/06/25    
Before reading baby rudin, I thought the amaze of taylor theorem is to use polynomial approximate functions. But the theorem is also a generalization of the mean value theorem! Let $f$ be a differentiable function on $\[a,b\]$, then we know there exists $x\in \(a,b\)$ such that $f(b)-f(a) = f'(x)(b-a)$. This can be generalized to n-th derivative. $f(b) - f(a) = \frac{f^n(x)}{n!}(b-a)^n$.  

Also, sequence of function is fun!  

Also Also, I am worried. Worried about the qual exam, worried about my driving test.

Today, I learned equicontinuity, happy happy happy.
