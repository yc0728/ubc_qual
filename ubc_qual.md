I plan to use the books:  
Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote  
Algebra: Chapter 0 by Paolo Aluffi  
Baby Rudin  
Big Rudin  
Maybe, Functions of one complex variable by Conway    
I am excited to start reading! But meanwhile, I am also a little bit worried as the past qual exams seem difficult...Hopefully things go well :) ALso, hope tonight Liverpool can win..

I back home for almost two weeks. I am in a class for a driving license (C1). Tomorrow will be the Subject 1 test. I also studied for the qual exam since April 8. In general, I am satisfied with my current life. But I have to say, I can do much better! I can study way longer than now. Hopefully, after passing the Subject 1 test, I can work harderrrrr!   

PS: there is a surprising result for finite groups: There is a unique fixed point free order 2 automorphism for finite groups, i.e. $g\mapsto g^{-1}$. And there is none for non-abelian groups! I dont know if this result is still true for infinite groups, since in the proof, I do use the fact of finiteness. Hint from Dummit & Foote: If $\psi$ is a fixed point free order 2 auto, then for all g in G, $g = x^{-1}\psi(x)$ for some $x\in G$. This can be proved by showing that $x\mapsto x^{-1}\psi(x)$ is a bijection from $G\to G$. The bijection comes from the injection and the finiteness.

A few days ago, I was reading the baby rudin. There is an amazing result: Let $\sum a_n$ be a series that converges non-absolutely. Let $-\infty\leq\alpha\leq\beta\leq\infty$. Then there exists an rearrangement, $\sum a^{'}_n$ with partial sum $s_n^{'}$, such that $liminf s_n^{'} = \alpha$ and $limsup s_n^{'} = \beta$.

Today, I did an interesting exercise on Baby Rudin. For a metric space $X$, there exists a completion, $X^*$. So I thought maybe we can construct $\mathbb{R}$ out of $\mathbb{Q}$ from completion.

I did the exercise a few days ago, construct $\mathbb{R}$ from Cauchy sequences. It is a completion of $\mathbb{Q}$. For completion, I mean every Cauchy seuqnces converge. It is a good exercise. I wrote down all of the exercise explicitly except to prove it is actually complete. But I indeed have a idea and I think my idea is correct.  

I also switched my algebra book to algebra: chapter 0. Dummit&Foote's book is too detailed. It kind of makes me bored. I only read a few section of Paolo's book. Great! I like it! 

Some non-academic update: I failed my driving license Subject 2 test today. I did pretty well at the mock tests. I nailed the mock tests. But I failed the test. I am afraid that this will delay my plan. But i comfort myself: If the plan can be delayed for 20 days, it is probably not very urgent. Furthermore, I am lucky for two times: got distinction and got admission from UBC. So it is time for me to be not luck. And it is just a driving test, not some big thing, so embrace it! Imagine Henderson, my failed driving test is not a problem, I will try next time!

I recently think of (maybe inspired) a proof of Bezout's theorem of integers. Let m,n be positive integers, gcd(m,n)=1, then there exists a,b such that am + bn =1. Although this result can be generalized to much bigger rings, perhaps UFD, let us only talk about integers now. The proof does not need Euclidean ALgorithm. Since gcd(m,n)=1, $[m]_n$ generates $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. So $[1]_n = a[m]_n$. This means $1\equiv am$ mod $n$. Hence bn = 1 - am.

I have to say, so far, the only topic makes me exicted in real analysis is integration!   


2024/06/25    
Before reading baby rudin, I thought the amaze of taylor theorem is to use polynomial approximate functions. But the theorem is also a generalization of the mean value theorem! Let $f$ be a differentiable function on $\[a,b\]$, then we know there exists $x\in \(a,b\)$ such that $f(b)-f(a) = f'(x)(b-a)$. This can be generalized to n-th derivative. $f(b) - f(a) = \frac{f^n(x)}{n!}(b-a)^n$.  

Also, sequence of function is fun!  

Also Also, I am worried. Worried about the qual exam, worried about my driving test.

Today, I learned equicontinuity, happy happy happy.  


2024/06/29    
I am amazed by weierstrass theorem, every real continuous function on $\[a,b\]$ can be approxiamted by a sequence of polynomials! One more reason to study polynomial. Since polynomial functions form an algebra which separates points and vanishes at no points. This theorem can be generalized by Stone.  
PS: Rudin's exercises are difficult!

I have to say, some construction of rudin's book is too clever to get the intuition.
